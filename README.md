# Aware [Deprecated - Not maintained anymore]
> Platform for people to raise their opinions and concerns related to environment and pollution in their locality. Aware uses this data to access the "cleanliness", "greenery" and  "livability" of areas.

## How Aware works
After you install the app, you can post any message along with the proper tags and send it to the server. You will only be allowed to view messages which are in your proximity (i.e. a fixed radius). As an upvote on a post increases, the permissible radius for the post also increases, which creates a level of relevance for each post.
The authorities only have to act on the messages which are most concerning, rather than going through each post.

## Using Bulletin Board data
The data received by the platform can be used for a lot of purposes. Some being :-
 + Giving a pictorial representation of data reinforced on the 3D map of Delhi, showing the areas with most concerns for picking up trends.
 + Showing the "greenest" route between 2 places as opposed to "shortest" or "fastest" as suggested by Google Maps.
